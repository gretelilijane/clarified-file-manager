|===
| Type | ID | Description | Reasoning

| Session Management
| 3.3.2
| If authenticators permit users to remain logged in, verify that re-authentication occurs periodically, both when actively used and after an idle period. (C6)
| I did not check this before, and I wish to check it now.

| Server-Side Attacks
| 5.3.4
| Verify that data selection or database queries (e.g., SQL, HQL, ORM, NoSQL) use parameterized queries, ORMs, entity frameworks, or are otherwise protected from database injection attacks. 
| I was unsure which option to choose.

| XSS
| 12.5.2
| Verify that direct requests to uploaded files will never be executed as HTML/JavaScript content.
| While this is not possible with the current application (users can upload/download any type of file, but it is not executed by the browser), I would like to think through how to make it safer when using it in a different application or webpage.

| REST/API
| 13.2.3
| Verify that RESTful web services that utilize cookies are protected from Cross-Site Request Forgery via the use of at least one or more of the following: double submit cookie pattern, CSRF nonces, or Origin request header checks.
| I did not check this before, and I wish to check it now.

| File Management
| 12.4.2
| Verify that files obtained from untrusted sources are scanned by antivirus scanners to prevent the upload and serving of known malicious content.
| While I already know that this has not been implemented, and it is fairly easy to test, I am more interested in thinking through how to implement it on the webpage.
